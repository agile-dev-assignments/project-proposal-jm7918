# allocate.social

### What? Why?
A place where investors can share their portfolio allocation pies to better inform people about what they are trading. So that you can share your favorite assets with your friends who are constantely asking you what to buy. 

**Allocate Social** is a social network that allows investors to populate their portfolios and share with their friends. You can follow other users and if accepted you can see their portfolio pies.

Let's say you have a portfolio for just crypto(i.e 50% BTC and 50% ETC), or maybe a portfolio for reaching heard immunity(50% Disney, 50% a restrauant ETF, etc). You can now share these allocations with your friends so that new investors can see how other people are structuring their asset allocations. 


### Whom?
This is for investors who maybe have friends who are constantly asking what they should buy or what you are hodling. With Allocate you can allow those friends to follow you and see your different "Funds" or Allocation pies.

### How?
* User Authentication
  - Sign in
  - Allow users to follow each other
* Dashboard
  - displays the 'follows' of the user along with some metrics of how their portfolio is doing
* List of portoflios
  - Create a new portfolio
  - Edit existing portfolios
  - Delist old portfolios

* Settings & Profile
  - Edit profile info
    - Display name, profile pic, etc.


### Additional Notes
Ideally, I would like to have this work as follows: Sign in with a broker(Robinhood, Gemini, Webull, TD Ameritrade, etc.) --> Portfolio data is automatically populated --> Display interesting metrics such as Sharpe Ratios, etc. to provide better data to retail traders. Hooking up to all of theses apis will be time consuming, so considering which to include and which to leave out.
